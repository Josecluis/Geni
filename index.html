    <p>“Crypto is Freedom: Financial Freedom and Transactional Freedom. The more relevant crypto becomes, the less relevant the evil actors of humanity will become. Crypto and decentralized assets PROTECTED FROM ALL NATIONAL POWERS are the best way for people to claim their sovereignty, strip government of the potential for any abusive powers, make war too expensive for humanity to engage in, and restore the duty of government to work for the people and enable the people to exercise the ultimate level of personal responsibility, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This is 1776 version 2.0.”</p>


    <P class="quote">Important Note: if you choose to partake in the sacrifice, you must have no expectation
    of profit, nor expectation of profit derived from the work of others.</P>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong>  Throughout this document, GENI will refer to the Legacy GENI token. You can view the token contract address at https://geni.to/geni.</p>

    <p class="block-quote">Sacrifice Points will be awarded on the following basis:</p>

    <ul class="icon-list">
      <li>
        <span class="list-ico"><img src="img/list-ico2.png" alt=""></span>Sacrifices should only be made from the Ethereum mainnet with Ether (ETH) or any ofthe following ERC20 tokens: GENI, HEX, SHIB, WBTC, CRO, LINK, MANA, USDC, USDT, TUSD, BUSD, and DAI.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="list-ico"><img src="img/list-ico2.png" alt=""></span>Sacrifices can also be made on the Binance Smart chain (BSC); however, only the native Binance Coin (BNB) and approved stable coins will be accepted on BSC.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="list-ico"><img src="img/list-ico2.png" alt=""></span>The only non-stable Ethereum-based coins that will receive Sacrifice Points are GENI, ETH, HEX, SHIB, WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin), CRO, LINK, and MANA.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="list-ico"><img src="img/list-ico2.png" alt=""></span>The only Ethereum-based stable coins that will receive Sacrifice Points are: USDC, USDT, TUSD, BUSD, and DAI.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="list-ico"><img src="img/list-ico2.png" alt=""></span>Do not sacrifice directly from an exchange (i.e., Coinbase, Binance, etc.) or you will not receive the Sacrifice Points. Only sacrifice directly from your own wallet where you hold the private keys (i.e., MetaMask).
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="list-ico"><img src="img/list-ico2.png" alt=""></span>Each $1 value of your sacrifice will be awarded up to 100 points based on when you sacrifice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="list-ico"><img src="img/list-ico2.png" alt=""></span>Each 1 GENI that you sacrifice will be awarded up to 333 points based on the when you sacrificed. Therefore, if GENI’s price is less than $3.33, there is an incentive to buy GENI from Uniswap for sacrificing.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
      <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This is not an investment of any kind, and sacrifice points have zero monetary value. Any points awarded to you as part of the sacrifice do not provide you with any legal, equitable or other any rights in relation to GENI or any individual or company involved in the GENI community. For the avoidance of doubt, you are not entitled to any voting, equity participation or any other rights that would ordinarily attach to a share of a company.</p>

    <p class="block-quote">Point Multipliers:</p>
    <div class="block2"> 
      <p>Earlier Pays Better” (EPB) Multiplier: 
The earlier you sacrifice, the more points you will receive. There will be a maximum of 10 days at the beginning where the sacrifice may receive the maximum number of sacrifice points. The sacrifice rate for token values and GENI will then increase by 5% every day thereafter. For example, with Ether value (in USD), ERC20 value (in USD), and stable coin units, the number of units necessary for 100 points are as follows:</p>

    <ul class="list-white">
      <li>Days 1-10: $1.00</li>
      <li>Day 11: $1.05</li>
      <li>Day 12: $1.1025</li>
      <li>Day 13: $1.1576</li>
      <li>Day 14: $1.2155</li>
      <li>Etc.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The formula to calculate the number of USD units per 100 sacrifice points is:</p>
      <p class="formula">= MAX(1, 1.05^(Sacrifice Day - 10))</p>
<p>And to calculate the number of points per USD:</p>
      <p class="formula">= 100 / MAX(1, 1.05^(Sacrifice Day - 10))</p>

<p>The worst sacrifice rate for 100 points is on Day 28, with a rate of about $2.40 per 100 Sacrifice Points.</p>

<p><strong>“Bigger Pays Better” (BPB) Multiplier:</strong>All sacrifices will be totaled and ranked by sending address. A multiplier will be applied for each point, starting from the largest sacrifice point address to the smallest. The top address may earn up to 2.5x points.</p>


<p><strong>“GENI Pays Better” (GPB) Multiplier:</strong> 
When Legacy GENI is sacrificed, the Earlier Is Better Multiplier also applies; however, the starting rate for 1 Legacy GENI is 333 Sacrifice Points. The number of units necessary for 333 points are as follows:</p>

  <ul class="list-white">
      <li>Days 1-10: 1.00 Legacy GENI</li>
      <li>Day 11: 1.05 Legacy GENI</li>
      <li>Day 12: 1.1025 Legacy GENI</li>
      <li>Day 13: 1.1576 Legacy GENI</li>
      <li>Day 14: 1.2155 Legacy GENI</li>
      <li>Etc.</li>
    </ul>
    
<p>The formula to calculate the number of Legacy GENI units per 333 sacrifices points is the same as calculating the number of USD units (for ETH, HEX, and stable coins). Calculating the number of points per Legacy GENI is similar:</p>
<p class="formula">= 333 / MAX(1, 1.05^(Sacrifice Day - 10))</p>

<p>For as long as the market price of Legacy GENI remains under $3.33, people who sacrifice will get more sacrifice points by purchasing and sacrificing Legacy GENI.
The worst sacrifice rate for 333 points is on Day 28, with a rate of about 2.4 GENI per 333 Sacrifice Points.</p>

  </section>
  <section class="mark">

   <p class="block-quote"> For the first 10 days, every GENI sacrificed will yield
at least $3.33 worth of Sacrifice Points.</p>
  
  <p>Duration: the sacrifice will last for a total of 28 days only, and during this time you may sacrifice as many times as you choose. Any sacrifice sent past the end of the 28th day will earn zero sacrifice points.
Multiple Sacrifices: you may decide to sacrifice several times from the same wallet. Your total points will be calculated by aggregating these amounts and recognizing the delay for each amount sacrificed.
Sacrifice Distribution: all sacrifice points will be scaled to distribute 240 Billion of the Official GENI contract’s tokens. At the most, another 35 Million Legacy GENI will be in circulation (and not sacrificed), and this will represent a maximum of 35 Billion official GENI to be minted. Therefore, GENI’s official starting supply will be between 240 Billion and 275 Billion GENI.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>
<ul class="list-white">
  <li>The maximum supply of the official GENI token will be 275 Billion GENI.</li>
  <li>240 Billion GENI will be distributed to the accounts that participated in the Sacrifice.</li>
  <li>A maximum of the 35 Million Legacy GENI left in circulation will be able to mint a maximum of another 35 Billion Official GENI.</li>
</ul> 

<p><strong>How to Sacrifice:</strong> sacrificing is done by sending Legacy GENI or the approved ERC20 tokens to a published ERC20 sacrifice address. The address will be posted on https://geni.app (or another domain To Be Determined) and will also be available on the telegram channel:
https://t.me/genicrypto</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Sacrifice:</strong> if the Sacrifice address is released before the official sacrifice start date is announced, pre-sacrifices will receive the maximum sacrifice points at the best rate.</p>
